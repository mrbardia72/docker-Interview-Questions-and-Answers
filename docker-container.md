# Docker Containers Interview Questions and Answers

## What is Docker?
* Docker is a tool that enables you to create, deploy, and run applications inside of self-contained “containers.” This allows for much greater portability and flexibility when it comes to developing and deploying applications.


* Docker is a tool that helps you create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow you to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. This means that your application will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.


## Can you explain some of the main components and concepts associated with Docker?
Some of the main components and concepts associated with Docker include images, containers, layers, and registries. Images are used to create containers, which are self-contained environments that can be run on any compatible host. Layers are used to create images, and registries are used to store and distribute images.

## How are containers different from virtual machines?
Containers are different from virtual machines in a few key ways. First, containers don’t require their own dedicated operating system – they can share the host operating system with other containers. This makes them much more lightweight and efficient than virtual machines. Second, containers are designed to be immutable – once you create and deploy a container, you shouldn’t need to make any changes to it. This makes them much easier to manage and keep track of than virtual machines, which can often become “snowflakes” over time as they are updated and changed.

## What are some key features of a container?
Containers are isolated from each other and the underlying host operating system. This allows for consistent runtime environments and makes it easy to package and deploy applications. Containers are also lightweight and fast, making them ideal for microservices and other distributed applications.

## Why do we need to use containers in development environments?
Containers provide a consistent development environment that can be used on any machine, regardless of operating system. This makes it easy to develop and test applications on different machines without having to worry about inconsistencies between environments.

## How can you achieve scalability when using containers?
One way to achieve scalability when using containers is to use a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes. This tool can help you manage a large number of containers and ensure that they are all running smoothly. Another way to achieve scalability is to use a container management platform like Docker Swarm. This platform can help you to deploy and manage a large number of containers across multiple servers.

## What is the basic command used for creating an image in Docker?
The basic command for creating an image in Docker is “docker build.” This command will take the necessary files and create an image that can be used to create a container.

## Is it possible to run multiple commands at once in Docker? If yes, then how?
Yes, it is possible to run multiple commands at once in Docker. This can be accomplished by using the “&&” operator to chain the commands together. For example, if you wanted to run the commands “ls” and “pwd” at the same time, you would use the following command:

```docker run -it –rm myimage sh -c “ls && pwd”```

## What’s the difference between a Docker image and a Docker container?
A Docker image is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a Docker container. Images are used to create containers. A Docker container is a runnable instance of an image—it is the combination of an image and the command that was used to create it.

## What is the basic command that should be used to stop a running container?
The basic command to stop a running container is “docker stop.” This command will send a SIGTERM signal to the container, which will cause it to shut down gracefully.

## What are some of the most commonly used Docker commands?
The most commonly used Docker commands are:

* docker build: Used to build a new Docker image from a Dockerfile
* docker run: Used to launch a new Docker container from an existing image
* docker pull: Used to pull a Docker image from a registry
* docker push: Used to push a Docker image to a registry

## What is a bridge in Docker?
A bridge is a virtual network device that connects Docker containers to each other and to the outside world. By default, every container is attached to a bridge called “docker0”.

## What happens when you run a dockerized application on a server?
When you run a dockerized application on a server, the application is packaged into a container along with all of its dependencies. The container is then run on the server, allowing the application to be isolated from the rest of the system. This makes it easy to deploy and run applications on servers, as they can be run in any environment that supports Docker.

## What does the “docker ps” command do?
The “docker ps” command lists all of the running Docker containers on a system.

## What’s the best way to handle two containers that require a shared volume?
There are a few different ways to handle two containers that require a shared volume, but the best way may depend on your specific use case. One option is to use a named volume, which can be created using the docker volume create command. This will allow both containers to access the volume by name. Another option is to use a host volume, which can be created by mounting a host directory into the container. This can be done using the -v flag when starting the container.

## What is a Docker daemon?
A Docker daemon is a process that runs on a host machine and is responsible for building and running Docker containers. The daemon listens for API requests from Docker clients and handles the heavy lifting of building and running containers.

## Can you explain what namespaces are in context with Docker?
Namespaces are a Linux kernel feature that allows for complete isolation between different processes running on a single system. This is accomplished by giving each process its own virtual view of the system, which means that they are unable to see or interact with any other processes outside of their namespace. Docker containers make use of this feature to provide complete isolation between the different containers running on a single host.

## What are control groups and how do they work?
Control groups are a Linux kernel feature that allows system administrators to group processes together and manage them as a unit. This can be useful for a number of reasons, such as limiting the amount of resources that a particular group of processes can use, or isolating a group of processes from each other. Control groups are implemented in the Linux kernel and are used by a number of containerization technologies, including Docker.

## What is Docker Hub?
Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service for storing and sharing Docker images. With Docker Hub, you can create and manage your own repositories, either public or private, and share images with other Docker users.

## What are the main benefits of using Docker containers?
The main benefits of using Docker containers are that they are portable, lightweight, and easy to use. Docker containers can be used to package and ship applications quickly and easily, and they can be run on any platform that supports Docker. Containers are also much lighter weight than virtual machines, so they can be deployed and run more quickly.

## Can you explain what a container is in the context of Docker?
A container is a self-contained unit of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, etc. Containers are isolated from each other and can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and share that kernel with other containers. This makes them much more efficient than virtual machines, which typically run on top of a hypervisor and have their own kernel.

## How do you go about creating and running a new container with Docker?
The first step is to create a new Dockerfile. This file will contain all of the instructions necessary to build your container. Once your Dockerfile is ready, you can then use the ‘docker build’ command to create your container. Finally, once your container is built, you can use the ‘docker run’ command to launch it.

## What’s the difference between a Docker image and a container?
A Docker image is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a Docker container. Images are used to create containers. A container is a runnable instance of an image—what the image becomes in memory when actually executed. It runs completely isolated from the host environment by default, only accessing host files and ports if configured to do so.

## How can you ensure that your container only runs one process at a time?
By default, Docker containers will run multiple processes at the same time. However, you can use a tool like Supervisor to help manage and monitor processes inside of a container so that only one process is running at a time.

## Why should I use port-mapping instead of directly exposing ports on a container? What are the advantages?
By port-mapping, you can control which host ports are mapped to which container ports. This gives you more flexibility and security, as you can change the host port mapping at any time without having to change the container configuration. Additionally, it is generally considered more secure to not expose container ports directly to the host, as this can open up the host to potential attacks.

## How can you build an image from a Dockerfile?
You can build an image from a Dockerfile using the docker build command. This command will take a Dockerfile as input and produce a new image as output.

## What is the purpose of a Docker volume? When would you use it?
A Docker volume is a directory that is used to store data for a Docker container. This data is stored outside of the container itself, which means that it is not deleted when the container is deleted. This can be useful for storing data that needs to be persistent, such as a database.

## What’s the best way to copy files into a container? Is there any disadvantage of doing so?
The best way to copy files into a container is to use the docker cp command. This command will allow you to copy files from your host machine into a running container. The disadvantage of using this method is that it can be slow, and if you are copying a large number of files, it can take up a lot of disk space.

## How does Linux Containers compare to Docker containers?
Docker containers are a type of Linux container. Linux containers are a way to isolate processes from each other on a single host, allowing multiple processes to run on a single host without them interfering with each other. Docker containers add an additional layer of abstraction on top of Linux containers, making it easier to package and deploy applications.

## Can you explain what container orchestration is and why it’s important?
Container orchestration is the process of managing and coordinating multiple containers so that they can work together to achieve a common goal. This is important because it allows for the efficient use of resources and ensures that all containers are able to communicate with each other and work together as intended.


## What does the -v flag mean when starting a new container? Give me some examples.
The -v flag stands for volume, and it is used to mount a volume from the host machine into the container. This is useful for data that needs to be persisted outside of the container, such as logs or application data. For example, if you have a web application that is running in a container, you might use the -v flag to mount the application’s data directory into the container so that the data is not lost if the container is stopped or deleted.

## Is it possible to run multiple processes inside a single container? If yes, then how?
Yes, it is possible to run multiple processes inside a single container. This can be accomplished by using a process manager, such as Supervisord. Supervisord can be used to start, stop, and monitor multiple processes inside a single container.

## Can you list out all the parameters available for configuring a Docker container?
There are a number of parameters that can be configured when setting up a Docker container, including:

* CPU shares: This parameter sets the relative amount of CPU time that a container can use.
* Memory: This parameter sets the amount of memory that a container can use.
* Network mode: This parameter sets the networking mode for a container, which can be either “bridge” (the default), “host”, or “none”.
* Restart policy: This parameter sets the policy for automatically restarting a container.
* Volumes: This parameter sets the volumes that should be mounted inside a container.

## What is the syntax for accessing environment variables defined in the host machine from within a docker container?
The syntax for accessing environment variables defined in the host machine from within a docker container is:

```${HOST_ENV_VAR}```

## Why would you want to create aliases for commonly used commands in Docker?
By creating aliases for commonly used commands in Docker, you can save time and typing by having the commands automatically expanded to their full form. This can be particularly useful if you are working with long or complex commands that you don’t want to have to remember or type out in full every time.

## How can you cleanly shut down a container without losing data?
The best way to cleanly shut down a container without losing data is to use the commit command. This command will take a snapshot of the container’s current state and save it as a new image. Once you have done this, you can then use the stop command to gracefully shut down the container.

## What do you understand by “daemonized Docker containers”? What do they have to do with sidecar patterns?
Daemonized Docker containers are those that have been configured to run in the background as a daemon process. This is often done in order to keep the container running even if the user logs out of the host machine. Sidecar patterns are a way of structuring daemonized Docker containers so that they can work together to provide a complete service. This often involves one container running the actual service and another container running a process to monitor and manage the service.

## How do you manage access control to a Docker daemon socket?
By default, the Docker daemon socket is only accessible to the root user. This means that any user who wants to access the Docker daemon must have root privileges. However, it is possible to change this so that the Docker daemon is accessible to non-root users. To do this, you can create a Unix group called docker and add any users who should have access to the Docker daemon to that group.

## What is the best way to make sure that my container doesn’t consume too much memory?
One way to make sure that your container doesn’t consume too much memory is to use a tool like cgroups-limit to set a maximum limit on the amount of memory that the container can use. You can also use a tool like Docker Compose to specify memory limits for your containers.

## What are the various ways to configure a Docker network?
There are three ways to configure a Docker network:

* By using the –net option when starting a container
* By using the –link option when starting a container
* By using the docker network command
