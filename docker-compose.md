# Docker Compose Interview Questions and Answers

## Can you explain what Docker Compose is?
Docker Compose is a tool that helps you manage multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you can define a single application that consists of multiple services, and then run that application in a single process. This makes it easy to coordinate your application’s services and ensures that they are all running in the correct order.

## What are the main benefits of using Docker Compose for docker containers?
Docker Compose is a great tool for managing docker containers because it allows you to define all of your containers and their configurations in a single yaml file. This makes it easy to spin up and down entire applications made up of multiple containers with a single command. Additionally, Docker Compose can be used to define environment variables, link containers together, and specify which ports should be exposed.

## What are some important features of Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## How can you install Docker Compose on a Linux box?
You can install Docker Compose on a Linux box by running the following command:

```
sudo curl -L “https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)” -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```


## Can you give me an example of how to use Docker Compose with MySQL and PHPMyAdmin?
Here’s an example of how you could use Docker Compose with MySQL and PHPMyAdmin.

In your docker-compose.yml file, you would first need to specify the versions of each component that you’re using:

```yaml
version: ‘3’
services:
db:
image: mysql:5.7
volumes:
– db_data:/var/lib/mysql
restart: always
environment:
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: somewordpress
MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
MYSQL_USER: wordpress
MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress

wordpress:
depends_on:
– db
image: wordpress:latest
ports:
– “8000:80”
restart: always
environment:
WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress
WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
```
This will start up a MySQL database and a WordPress instance that is connected to it. You can then access PHPMyAdmin by going to http://localhost:8000/phpmyadmin in your browser.

##  What is the purpose of the docker-compose command in Docker?
The docker-compose command is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## What’s the difference between up, start and run in Docker Compose?
The main difference between up, start and run is that up also builds the images for you, whereas start and run assume that the images already exist. Start and run are essentially the same, except that run will also execute a command in the container once it starts up.

## Is it possible to specify multiple compose files when running a container from Docker Compose? If yes, then how?
Yes, it is possible to specify multiple compose files when running a container from Docker Compose. You can do this by using the -f flag followed by the path to the desired compose file. For example, if you wanted to use two compose files named file1.yml and file2.yml, you would use the following command: docker-compose -f file1.yml -f file2.yml up

## What do you understand about services and networks as used by Docker Compose?
Services are defined in a docker-compose.yml file and are essentially a collection of containers that are deployed together. A network is a virtual network that allows containers to communicate with each other.

## What are some common operations that can be performed using Docker Compose CLI commands?
Some common operations that can be performed using Docker Compose CLI commands include creating and starting containers, stopping and removing containers, and viewing logs.

## Can you explain what environment variables are and what role they play in Docker Compose?
Environment variables are variables that are set outside of the Docker Compose file and are used to configure the containers that are created when you run “docker-compose up”. These variables can be used to set things like the hostname or IP address of a container, the username and password for a database, or any other number of things.

## What happens if certain configuration values are not specified in a Docker Compose file?
If certain configuration values are not specified in a Docker Compose file, then the default values for those settings will be used. For example, if you do not specify a particular network mode, then the default network mode will be used.

## Is there any way to override default settings like port numbers when using Docker Compose? If yes, then how?
Yes, it is possible to override the default settings in a docker-compose.yml file. You can do this by specifying the desired setting in the file, and then using the override command when starting up your containers.

## What is your opinion on using .yml vs .yaml extension for Docker Compose files?
I don’t really have a strong opinion on the matter. I think that either extension would be fine to use.

## What are build instructions and why are they useful while working with Docker Compose?
Build instructions are a set of commands that are used to build an image from a Dockerfile. These instructions are generally used when you are working with a team of developers and need to ensure that everyone is using the same image. By specifying the build instructions in the docker-compose.yml file, you can ensure that everyone on your team is using the same image when they build their containers.

## What is the significance of the restart directive in Docker Compose?
The restart directive is used to specify whether or not a container should be restarted if it is stopped for any reason. By default, containers are not restarted if they are stopped. However, you can use the restart directive to tell Docker Compose to always restart a particular container if it is stopped. This can be useful if you have a container that is critical to your application and you want to make sure that it is always running.

## What is the order of execution of directives specified in a Docker Compose file?
The order of execution of directives in a Docker Compose file is as follows:
1. build
2. image
3. command
4. depends_on
5. links
6. ports
7. volumes
8. environment
9. net
10. dns
11. dns_search
12. extra_hosts
13. depends_on
14. extends
15. external_links
16. log_driver
17. log_opt
18. pid
19. restart
20. security_opt
21. shm_size
22. ulimits
23. user
24. working_dir

## What is the best approach to follow while writing Docker Compose files?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best approach to writing Docker Compose files will vary depending on your specific needs and preferences. However, some tips that may be helpful include keeping your files as concise and readable as possible, using comments to explain your choices, and using named volumes rather than anonymous volumes wherever possible.

## What do you think is the best way to manage configs across environments when using Docker Compose?
There are a few different ways to manage configs across environments when using Docker Compose. One option is to use environment variables, which can be easily set and updated as needed. Another option is to use a separate config file for each environment, which can be loaded into Docker Compose as needed. Finally, you could also use a tool like Consul to manage your configs, which would provide a central location for all of your configs and make it easy to update them as needed.

## What are some security concerns related to Docker Compose?
One of the main security concerns related to Docker Compose is that it can be used to create what are known as “container sprawl” issues. This happens when too many containers are created and not all of them are properly managed, leading to a situation where it becomes difficult to keep track of all of them and ensure that they are all secure. Another concern is that Docker Compose can be used to create “fat containers” which are containers that have a lot of unnecessary data and files in them, which can lead to security issues if those files are not properly secured.
